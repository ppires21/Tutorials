# 📚 Tutorials Repository

Welcome to **Tutorials**!  
This repository is my personal collection of **step-by-step guides** in Markdown format.  

I created this repo both as:
- 📝 My **personal reference library** (because I often forget the steps 😅)
- 🌍 A resource for **others who want to learn** or quickly fix common problems

All tutorials contain **commands with explanations**, so you can copy, paste, and understand at the same time.

## 📖 Table of Contents (For now)

### 🔑 Git & GitHub
- [Git SSH Setup & First Push](git/git_github_ssh_and_push_guide.md)  
  *Generate SSH keys, add them to GitHub, link your repo, and push your code.*
- [Fixing Git Remotes](git_fixing_remotes.md)  
  *Solve errors like `'origin' does not appear to be a git repository'` and manage remotes.*
